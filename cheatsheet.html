					<h2>What are JS objects?</h2>

					Variables are containers for data and can be either numbers or words (a string). The syntax is as such:
					var *nameOfVariable* = *value*
					var x = 5;  // an integer, called x, containing the value 5
					var message = “Hello world!”; // a string, called message, containing text
					var empty; // a variable, called empty, which is undefined (it is neither a string nor number)

					Note: you cannot create two variables with the same name

					JavaScript Objects are similar to real life objects. They have properties and you can also do things to the objects. In JavaScript, doing something to an object can be described as using a method on an object.

					Create a JavaScript Object with:
					Object Literal: Most common way to create an object
					var myObject = {} 		// An empty object

					var person = {			// An object with 2 items
						name: “Bob”;
						age: 19;
					}

					OR

					Object Constructor: The next most common method to create an object
					var person = new Object ();
					person.name = “Bob”;
					person.age = 19;

					The Constructor pattern is another way to use the object constructor with ‘this,’ which refers to the global object.
					function Person(theName, theAge) {
						this.name = theName;
						this.age = theAge; }
					var bob = Person(“Bob”, 19);

					The prototype pattern can also be used as an alternative for creating objects. For example:
					function Person() { }
					Person.prototype.name = “Bob”;
					Person.prototype.age = 19;
					var bob = new Person(); // calls the constructor to create bob with properties name = “Bob” and age = 19
				</pre>

					<h2>Object Properties</h2>

					Properties are values associated with a JavaScript object. They can be accessed two ways:
					dot notation: obj.propertyName 
					OR
					square bracket notation: obj[propertyName]

					Accessing and Enumerating Properties on Objects using a for/in loop:
					Ex.
					var school = {name:”Dev Bootcamp”, location:”Chicago”, cohort1:”Squirrels 2015”}
					for (var eachItem in school) {
					console.log(eachItem); // Prints name, location, cohort1
					}

					Dot notation is easier to write and read.  Square bracket notation allows access to properties containing special characters and selection of properties using variables.
					Ex.
					var school = {name:”Dev Bootcamp”, location:”Chicago”, cohort1:”Squirrels 2015”}
					console.log(school.name); // Dev Bootcamp
					console.log(school[“cohort” + 1]); // Squirrels 2015

					hasOwnProperty returns a boolean value indicating if the object being called has a property with the name of the argument in parenthesis. This is useful when enumerating properties of an object in the for...in construct.
					Ex.
					var school - {schoolName:”Dev Bootcamp”};
					console.log(school.hasOwnProperty(“schoolName”));

					Each data property has 3 Attributes:
					Configurable: Specifies whether the property can be deleted or changed.
					Enumerable: Specifies whether the property can be returned ina for/in loop
					Writable: Specifies whether the property can be changed.

					Every JavaScript function has a prototype property (empty by default), and you attach properties and methods on this prototype property when implementing inheritance. The prototype property is not enumerable (inaccessible in for/in loop).

					An object’s prototype attribute points to the object’s “parent”—the object it inherited its properties from. The prototype attribute is normally referred to as the prototype object, and it is set automatically when you create a new object.

					<h2>Object Defitions</h2>
					JavaScript functions are defined by either a declaration or an expression. Functions are sequences of instructions that can be triggered by one line of code -- substitute repeated code with functions.

					Function Declarations:
					function functionName (parameter1, parameter2) {
						...
					}

					Functions can also return values. Here, a function requires two paramaters, and returns their sum.
					function doSomething(x, y) {
						return x + y;
					}

					Function Expression:
					Function expressions are an alternative to function declarations:
					var doSomething = function (x, y) { return x + y; }


					For both methods, you can call the function in the same way:
					var sum = doSomething(5, 12);  // 5 + 12 ==> returns 17

					Object Literals:
					Object literals are essentially a list of key, value pairs. For example:
					var Human = {
						age: 19,	  // must have a comma unless it’s the last pair
						name: “Jamal”,
						isAdult: true,

						// a function in an object
						printInfo: function() {  
					Console.log(Human.name + “ is “ + Human.age + “ years old!”);
					} // last pair, no comma
					}; // must end with a semicolon
					Human.age = 20; // the value can be changed
					Human.printInfo(); // prints “Jamal is 20 years old!” to the console
				</pre>

					<h2>Object Methods</h2>

					Access a method with the following syntax:
					obj.methodName();

					The most reliable method to see if an object is an array:
					isArr = Object.prototype.toString.call(arrayiter) == '[object Array]';

					Number Methods
					constructor(): Returns the function that created this object's instance. By default this is the Number object.
					toFixed(): Formats a number with a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal.
					toPrecision(): Defines how many total digits (including digits to the left and right of the decimal) to display of a number.
					toString(): Returns the string representation of the number's value.

					Boolean Methods
					toSource(): Returns a string containing the source of the Boolean object; you can use this string to create an equivalent object.
					toString(): Returns a string of either "true" or "false" depending upon the value of the object.

					String Methods
					charAt(index): Returns the character at the specified index.
					concat(string1, string2): Combines the text of two strings and returns a new string.
					indexOf(string): Returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, or -1 if not found.
					length(): Returns the length of the string.
					match(regex): Used to match a regular expression against a string.
					replace(findThisStr, replacementStr): Used to find a match between a regular expression and a string, and to replace the matched substring with a new substring.
					search(str): Searches the string for a matching string or reg. expression -- returns the index at the match
					slice(index1, index2): Extracts a section of a string and returns a new string.
					split(delimeter): Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings.

					Array Methods
					concat(array): Returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other array(s) and/or value(s).
					every(): Returns true if every element in this array satisfies the provided testing function.
					filter(): Creates a new array with all of the elements of this array for which the provided filtering function returns true.
					forEach(): Calls a function for each element in the array.
					indexOf(obj): Returns the first (least) index of an element within the array equal to the specified value, or -1 if none is found.
					join(): Joins all elements of an array into a string.
					map(funct): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
					pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
					push(object): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
					reduce(function	): Apply a function simultaneously against two values of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value.
					reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements of an array -- the first becomes the last, and the last becomes the first.
					shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
					slice(): Extracts a section of an array and returns a new array.
					sort(): Sorts the elements of an array.
					splice(): Adds and/or removes elements from an array.
