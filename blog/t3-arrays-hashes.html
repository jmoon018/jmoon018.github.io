				<h2>Arrays vs. Hashes -- What are they? Why do I care?</h2>

				<p>
					There are many problems in the computer science field that are heavily
					researched and studied, and one of them is finding the optimal way
					to store and retrieve data. This is a very important problem because our
					computers would have incredibly poor performance if we didn't have efficient
					ways of organizing static data --- think about it, when you type something
					in Google Search, it will say "900,000,000 results found," but the results
					will display for you in just a fraction of a second! There is no way for
					a computer to scan through a hundred million web sites and determine the
					most relevant articles in a split second without having efficient data
					structures. There are plenty of other examples that require smart 
					programming, but there are too many to list. So now that we understand the
					importance of data structures for computing, I will discuss in some
					detail two of the most essential data structures: Arrays and Hashes
				</p>


				<p>
					<b>Arrays</b> are very commonly used and have a simple concept behind them. Arrays,
					essentially, are a list of items (can be numbers, or words, or characters, etc)
					that can quickly be accessed. So if you wanted to list your favorite movies, you 
					would use an array. If you wanted to have a list of all the people in your class,
					you would store their names in an array. And so on. The advantage of arrays 
					are that the computer can INSTANTLY retreive/change an item in the array, whereas,
					with other data structures, the computer has to perform calculations to get to
					the item, and THEN it can retrieve/change the item. They are fast because
					of how they are physically stored in memory, but I don't want to get into
					too much detail; just understand that they can get/change items fast. However,
					there is a downside--the list has a certain capacity, say 10 items, and when
					you exceed that capacity, the computer has to perform extra calculations to 
					make sure that you can add the 11th item.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Hashes</b>, also called Dictionaries, are a bit different. They differences
					lie in how they are stored (slightly) and the data they contain. With arrays, the items
					are stored by when an item is put in the list. So if I put Sharknado, then Avengers
					into an array (of movies), it would look something like this: "1. Sharknado, 2. Avengers"
					and the order will not change. So the programmer tells the computer: "GET THE FIRST/SECOND/*INSERT NUMBER* ITEM
					IN THE ARRAY" and the computer will print out "SHARKNADO!" or whatever item is 
					in the 1st/2nd/3rd/etc spot. Hashes are different. A hash stores data in <i>pairs</i>.
					A good example is if you wanted to store a list of your friends and their favorite 
					movies, you'd want to use a hash. It would look something like this: <br>
					{"Jamal"==>"Avengers", "Rebecca"=>"Avatar", "David"=>"Hostel IV"}. <br>
					To retrieve the favorite movie, the programmer would input to the computer "JAMAL"
					and the computer would return "AVENGERS", and so on. Rather than ordering things based
					on where they are in the list, hashes order things based on the first item in the pair (in this case,
					the names), and when the programmer gives the computer the first item in the pair,
					the computer retrieves and returns the second item in the pair (in this case, the movie).
					This has the same advantages and disadvantages as Arrays to my knowledge. 
				</p>

				<p>
					So those are the basics of the two data structures. To wrap it up, you'd probably 
					want to use an array if you have just a normal list of data, EG: {Grass, Trees, Sunflowers} and you'd want to use
					hashes if you want a list of data pairs, EG: {Grass=>Green, Trees=>Brown, Sun Flowers=>Yellow}
