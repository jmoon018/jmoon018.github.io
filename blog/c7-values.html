				<h2>My Values</h2>

				<p>When I think of the times of my life where I've been the happiest, proudest,
				or most satisfied, the following values come to mind, and on a scale of 1
				to 5 on how much I try to live up to these values:</p>

				<ul class="listInBlog">
					<li>Accomplishment - 5</li>
					<li>Amibition - 5</li>
					<li>Autonomy - 5</li>
					<li>Challenge - 4</li>
					<li>Control - 4 </li>
					<li>Freedom - 4</li>
					<li>Friendships - 4</li>
					<li>Growth - 4 </li>
					<li>Honesty - 4</li>
					<li>Hospitality - 2</li>
					<li>Insight - 5</li>
					<li>Introspection - 5</li>
					<li>Knowledge - 5</li>
					<li>Leadership - 2</li>
					<li>Responsibility - 4</li>
				</ul>

				<p>One value in particular that is important to me is being challenged. I like
				to learn in general, and the best way to do so is through adversity/challenge. Challenges
				motivate me to do my best, give me an opportunity to show what I am (or am not) 
				capable of, and often teach me something either educational or something about
				myself. Challenges test the extent of my abilities and give me something to proud
				of after completing.</p>

				<p>When I think about my values, and when I do something that reflects them, I
				feel very accomplished and elated. However the inverse is also very much true,
				if I do something that opposes my values, I feel a burdening sense of guilt
				and disappointment. I try my best to control the emotions I feel -- so if I make
				a cool accomplishment, I try not to get my spirits up way too high or get too 
				cocky, and when I perform poorly, I try not to beat myself up too much, or else
				it would snowball into more failures. I do think that one can mediate stereotype
				if they recognize it by remembering their values and passion; one should understand
				him or herself moreso than others do and refer to their values when reflecting instead
				of believing in the negative stereotypes given to them. If I am feeling down, I will
				try to do an activity that would get my mind off of whatever is troubling me while
				boosting my confidence -- for example, playing a challenging but fun game is a great
				activity to increase confidence and ease stress. After some relaxation and breaks,
				I should be more than ready to tackle whatever is causing me trouble.
