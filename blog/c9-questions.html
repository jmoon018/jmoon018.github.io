				<h2>How to Ask Good Questions</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					Everyone asks questions. Yet, so often, people do not ask good questions. One would
					assume that people would know when and how to ask questions properly, but alas, we
					are not perfect, and there are some general rules about good questions that not everyone
					knows. We should strive our best to ask good questions because we are more likely to
					garner more attention and receive better answers. I will talk about a few tips
					that should help make the most awesome question out there.
				</p>

				<h3>Don't Ask a Duplicate Question!</h3>
				<p>
					People hate it when the same questions are asked over and over. It is a waste of time
					for all involved and it is often quicker for one to find an answer online than to ask
					and wait for help. Do your best to make sure your question is unique. If you saw an 
					answer to a question similar to your's, but you don't understand it, then ask for an
					explanation to that answer--it would surely help others too. By doing this, we can
					avoid cluttering internet forums with the same questions, save everyone some time,
					and provide better content for people who will eventually ask a question.
				</p>

				<h3>Write a Proper Title (on Q&A forums)</h3>
				<p>
					Vague titles suck. Try to write a title that will illustrate the problem you are having
					while being captivating to someone who glances over the title. This will help people
					understand what the question is about and might compel more people to click on the
					thread. It is better to have the title be wordy than to have a short, ambiguous title.
					I personally find it much easier to write the title AFTER asking the question---sometimes
					after I write the question, I may change the subject slightly, or I might want to emphasize
					something, and thus, I should change my title in order to reflect that.
				</p>

				<h3>Provide Proper Information in the Question</h3>
				<p>
					Ask the question. Explain any background information that would be necessary for someone
					to understand. Also explain what you have tried to do to solve the problem and reveal
					any resources you have looked at to assist you. If you are solving a math problem, for
					example, show the work you've done up until the step you got stuck on. Explain what you understand
					and other methods you have tried, and tell everyone what resources you used (eg: "I watched Khan
					Academy algebra video #xxx but I am still lost"). Narrow questions, with plenty of context,
					are very helpful to people who want to answer the questions. This makes sure that no redundant
					information is written and that the questions can be directly addressed. 
				</p>

				<h3>Proof-read</h3>
				<p>
					Fix typos. Make sure the grammar is correct. Try to phrase things in a way such that people
					will have an easy time reading and understanding, or else they may lose interest or
					answer the question incorrectly. Go over what you wrote and make sure that everything
					you wrote is relevant to the question or the one's understanding of the problem, and 
					also add anything that you feel you missed out on. It is also a good idea to have someone
					proofread the question for you before posting it on a forum
				</p>

				<h3>Respond to Feedback</h3>
				<p>
					Inevitably, people will need or want more information about the question you ask,
					and so they will ask questions. Answer them. It will help them and other people understand
					the question. If you are on a forum, try to edit the original post so that it contains
					the extra information that was asked.
				</p>

				<p>
					With these basic tools, you should be able to craft great questions and get plenty
					of good responses. There are also plenty of resources available online about asking
					the "perfect question" if this information is not adequate enough. Now that you've 
					read this, ask away!
