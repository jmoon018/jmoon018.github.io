				<h2>Issues in Tech - The Next Bubble</h2>

				<p>
					A lot of things happened during the turn of last millenia, and one of the most
					infamous events is the dot-com bubble. The dot-com bubble, also known as
					the inter bubble and dot-com boom, was an economic bubble between years
					1997-2000 that was marked by rapid growth in the Internet and related fields. 
					Investors, stockholders, and many others overvalued the tech companies
					when they were appraised, which subsequently led to increased investment in stocks
					and stock prices erupted. However, around year 2000 and 2001, the bubble
					popped and many companies either crumbled or lost a lot of capital; only a few
					companies survived the dot-com bubble to this day, such as Amazon and Yahoo.
				</p>

				<p>
					After studying the dot-com bubble, I noticed an eerie similarity to the Internet
					bubble and the present-day economy. Let's examine Silicon Valley as of
					2014; tons of technological advancements are produced each year, programmers
					are in high demand, startups are commonplace, and many companies have
					astronomical valuations. This sounds great, but I think this is also a sign
					of potentially bad events. Upon further inspection, the big tech companies,
					Facebook, Google, etc, are acquiring startups at the cost of millions, even
					billions of dollars, even though the startups aren't close to generating that
					type of money. For example, WhatsApp, a messaging application, was acquired by Facebook for $19,000,000,000 (yes, 19 billion)
					even though it was so small in comparison---less than 100 employees and not even
					$20,000,000 in profit. Facebook is basically valuing each employee to be worth
					at least $300,000,000. Facebook also acquired Oculus Rift, a virtual reality 
					system, for $2,000,000,000, even though all it has are prototypes and not even
					a consumer version (which they hope to launch in 2015). 
				</p>
				<p>
					So uh, doesn't any of that sound <i>kinda</i> fishy? These companies 
					are only making marginal profits, but they are being bought out by vast amounts
					of money, many orders of magnitude over. Well, why are the big companies investing so much money? I believe part of it
					is because of the competitive edge --- for example, lots of big companies may have
					wanted WhatsApp, and Facebook acquired it for $19 billion so that it would earn more
					market share in addition to making sure the WhatsApp employees are their's, not a 
					part of their competitors (Google, etc). Maybe they truly predict that the acquired
					tech businesses can directly generate enough profit to offset the initial investment.
					Perhaps they wanted the userbase that comes with WhatsApp. It's probably the sum of these
					reasons, but I am still dubious as to whether or not it was worth $19,000,000,000. 
					Facebook only made $1.5 billion in profit in 2013, so even if their profits increased
					by a half a billion each year, which a very liberal estimate, it would take a bit less
					than 7 years to regain the money invested into WhatsApp (if we are ignoring assets).
				</p>

				<p>
					There are many other examples of crazy acquisitions and high valuations which are
					too numerous to discuss so briefly --- Facebook isn't the only one doing this. 
					I think the excitement and prospects of technology, the fear of competitors fully
					acquiring businesses before anyone else gets the chance, and the high expectations
					of Silicon Valley businesses are leading to inaccurate valuations. I fear that 
					people are living in a bubble which will pop with devastating aftermath some 
					time in the future. I can't quite determine when, or how big its effects will be,
					but I am nearly certain it will happen in mere years. I could, of course, be wrong,
					but there are too many signs pointing to the possibility of being an economic bubble
					for me to say otherwise. Time will te..
