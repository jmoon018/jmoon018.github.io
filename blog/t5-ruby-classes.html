				<h2>Ruby Classes</h2>

				<p>In Ruby, classes are used to encapsulate data and methods
				for later use. Classes are just a convenient way to describe an object
				by defining what properties the object has and what the object can do.
				In this post, I will be trying to model a real-world object by using
				a class in Ruby.</p>

				<p>Let's try to model a real-world object such as a car. Before we begin
				programming, we must first allocate time to understanding precisely what
				a car is, what it does, and what properties it has. Start with the basic
				idea and then go into further detail; a car is "a wheeled, self-powered
				motor vehicle used for transprotation. Most definitions of the term specify
				that cars are designed to run primarily no roads, seat 1-8 people, and
				have four wheels." Ok good, now we have a slightly better idea of what
				a car is. 
				<br>
				Let's focus on its properties: 
				<ul>
					<li>it must have energy (or gas tank)</li>
					<li>it must have a driver and certain amount of passengers</li>
					<li>velocity/acceleration</li>
					<li>turn signals (right/left and on/off)</li>
					<li>license plate</li>
					<li>type of car</li>
					<li>color of the car</li>
				</ul>
				There are probably more properties, but we can stick with these for now.

				Now let's focus on the actions that a car can perform:
				<ul>
					<li>The car can turn on or off</li>
					<li>Drive (change velocity) or stop</li>
					<li>Turn right or left (this also affects the signals)</li>
					<li>Add or remove people</li>
				</ul>

				We should now have enough properties and methods in order to fulfill
				the basic definition of a car - a vehicle that can transport people across 
				roads.</p>

				<code>
				class Car<br>
					# this method is called when a car is first created
					# it MUST be called 'initialize'
					# the parameters in this method are passed when the car is created
					def initialize(license, type, color, maxGas)
						@license = license
						@type = type
						@color = color
						@maxGas = maxGas # in gallons
						@velocity = 0
						@rightSignal = false
						@leftSignal = false
						@people = [] # array of names of people in the car. First person is the driver
						@isOn = false
						@totalDistance = 0 # in miles
					end
				</code>
				<p>This is the first part of the class. This is the initialization method
				which is automatically called when you first create an instance of a class. This will
				give the car default values when you make one, and it will also pass down properties
				that you can specify when you create the car (such as the license plate #, type of car, etc).
				</p>

				<p>Now we have to add the methods that allow this car to function. Generally, the methods
				of the car will simply affect the properties of the car.</p>

				<code>
					def turnOn
						@isOn = true
					end

					def turnOff
						@isOn = false
					end

					# drive straight
					def drive(dist, mph)
						@velocity = mph  	   # change velocity
						@totalDistance += dist # add to the total distance, dont replace
						@rightSignal = false
						@leftSignal = false
					end

					def stop
						@velocity = 0
					end

					def turnRight
						@rightSignal = true
					end

					def turnLeft
						@leftSignal = true
					end

					def addPeople(name)
						@people << name 
					end

					def printState 
						puts "Car: #{@license}"
						puts "Type: #{@type}"
						puts "Color: #{@color}"
						puts "Car on: #{@isOn}"
						puts "Current speed: #{@velocity} mph"
						puts "Right signal on: #{@rightSignal}"
						puts "Left signal on: #{@leftSignal}"
						puts "People within: #{@people}"
						puts "Total distance: #{@totalDistance} miles"
					end
				end
				</code>

				<p>That gives us pretty much all the functionality that we require.
				We have enough methods to navigate on the road, add people to the car,
				drive, switch lanes, and enough propeties to correctly identify the
				car. Now let us test it.</p>

				<code>
					bmw = Car.new("ABC281A", "BMW", "Blue", 10) # these parameters are for the initialize method
					bmw.addPeople("Jamal")
					bmw.addPeople("Bob")
					bmw.addPeople("Alice")
					bmw.turnOn()
					bmw.turnRight()  # turn right, out of the driveway, onto the road
					bmw.drive(5, 25) # drive 5 miles at 25mph
					bmw.printState()
				</code>

				<p>If we run that chunk of code, the following is output:
				<ul>
					<li>Car: ABC281</li>
					<li>Type: BMW</li>
					<li>Color: Blue</li>
					<li>Car on:  true</li>
					<li>Current speed: 25 mph</li>
					<li>Right signal on: false </li>
					<li>Left signal on: false </li>
					<li>People within: Jamal, Bob, Alice</li>
					<li>Total distance: 5 miles</li>
				</ul>

				And that is what we expected too! And of course, we can add more complexity
				to the class and make it more realistic (for example, you can print an error
				if you try to drive when the car is off). However, this should give you a good
				idea about how to create a class and give it the desired functionality. Always
				start with an idea, detail / psuedocode what you want it to do, and then
				program it step by step. Test it thoroughly to ensure you get the results you want --
				you wouldn't want a fancy-looking, $20,000 car that doesn't turn on, would you?
