				<h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
				<p>Pairing is an essential task in the DevBootcamp program and is one that
				is very helpful in the real world -- most jobs require working with others,
				and there are techniques to maximize efficiency and productivity while
				getting along with your partner. It is therefore important that pairing
				and feedback are taken seriously and reflected upon, which I shall do in
				this blog post.</p>

				<p><i>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</i> <br>
				I was initially nervous, to be honest, because I am a bit more of
				a lonewolf. However I feel that I got along fine with everyone I paired
				with, and I learned quite a bit about programming and even a little about
				myself. The pairing sessions have been pretty insightful -- I learned
				things quicker than I would have learned by myself -- and it was very
				exciting after successfully completing a challenge.
				</p>

				<p><i>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</i> <br>
				The excitement of finishing a challenge, especially one in which my partner
				and I struggled with was very rewarding. It is also fun to tinker
				with different ways to solve a challenge and discovering novel approaches
				to use in the future. It was very fun to refactor code, especially
				after figuring out a way that significantly reduces code while
				maintaining clarity. </p>

				<p><i>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</i> <br>
				I don't think anything was really frustrating. I was content with my
				pairing partners because they were giving their 100% effort each time even
				if they were struggling with the material, and my partners who knew more
				than me were patient with explaining techniques to me. The most difficult
				thing was probably communicating -- I am a lazy speaker so I had to consciously
				speak better. I will talk about this later in this blog</p>

				<p><i>How did you feel when you read your feedback</i> <br>
				The whole feedback functionality is SO much more useful than I thought it would be.
				Many of my partners exchanged kind words while giving me tips for me in the future.
				I was oblivious to some of the mistakes I was making (eg: slightly poor communication)
				and I was able to improve because of the feedback, which is awesome.
				</p>

				<p><i>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</i><br>
				Yes, very much so. I learned that I was not communicating too well, for example,
				I was mumbling, my microphone level was too low, I was speaking too
				quickly, and so on. My partners sometimes struggled to understand me, and since 
				I read their feedback, I have improved my hardware and my attempts to 
				clearly express my ideas. I think my partners after that have had much
				more success understanding what I was saying.</p>

				<p><i>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</i>
				In addition to maintaining good communication, I also noticed that my knowledge about
				Ruby methods were lacking. I often asked my partners to explain certain Ruby methods
				that they were using, even though I should have known what they meant. Thus, I will
				study them in more depth so that I come to the pairing sessions better prepared.</p>

				<p><i>How was it to write feedback?</i> <br>
				It was a little bit difficult at first, but I think I am improving. I am trying
				to consciously keep a mental note of things to write for feedback while I am
				in the pairing session -- for example, if my pair is struggling with Ruby methods,
				I will first of all help him or her, and then provide actionable feedback
				based on what I saw. </p> 

				<p><i>What was the most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</i> <br>
				I had some difficulty writing actionable statements, especially when my partners
				were the ones doing the heavy lifting. Sometimes I can't really find any major
				issues with what my pair was doing, so the areas for improvement I mention
				are minor and probably won't help the pair improve too much. Additionally, I sometimes
				find it a little bit difficult keep the kind/friendly tone when giving the 
				constructive feedback (or it could just be in my head)</p>
