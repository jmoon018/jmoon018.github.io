#How I Learn Best, and Why DBC Suits Me Well

##Inner Thoughts about DBC

=========================================================

Upon watching this video (http://vimeo.com/85001014), I am even more convinced in my initial beliefs that DBC provides a unique
experience for its students. My pubic school experience was homogenous throughout an entire 12 years: walk into class at 8 AM, listen
to 6 hours of lectures, and return home with a few assignments. School was not even marginally engaging, and for a majority of 
the classes I took, I felt as if it was just a contest to see who could memorize the most material. Of course, memorization is
important, but I feel that it should be used in conjunction with real-life applications. To explain what I mean, I will provide 
an an anecdote.

In my senior year of high school, my physics class was tasked with creating a 2-man boat to float/paddle across the school's pool. Last year, 
I simply made a boat with my friends and hoped that it would float (and fortunately it did). This time, I wanted to apply my knowledge
from my phyiscs class to construct the optimal boat. I measured the length of my friend's arm and mine to find a comfortable 
height for the boat, the length of our sitting bodies to determine how long the boat should be, the density of the chlorine water,
our weights, and even the boat's weight. I then calculated the ideal dimensions for the boat and confirmed that it would float 
because I knew how the boat's volume and mass interated with the buoyant force of the water. We then built the boat based on my blueprint.
The time came. We set our boat in the water, got inside, and floated calmly. I stuck my arms out into the water and noticed
that the height of the boat above the water was perfect (compared to last year, the boat height was incredibly large, and my
arm would scratch against the side of the boat, yielding scars). My teammate and I confidently paddled until we reached halfway across
the pool and subsequently capsized. The boat leaked. Oops. 

Even though we didn't make it across, I felt engaged and learned A LOT. I decided to take a chance by tinkering with how to
make the boat (unlike most others who just built a big box) and reinforced my knowledge about newtonian mechanics and fluid
dynamics. The hands-on experience made this event memorable, and to this day, I can distinctly recall some calculations
and measurements I made (from finger tip to elbow: 22 inches, 68kg / person, shy of 6 ft for boat length, etc). It worked
because I wasn't told what to do, rather, I had the freedom to use what I learn and build something out of it. It was an opportunity
to make mistakes and learn from them; I am now certain I could make a pretty good darn boat if I get the chance to make it again.

So, back on track about DBC... DBC reminds me of the personal experience I just talked about. Lectures are only a small part of what DBC does.
Projects and tinkering seem to be a paramount part of the DBC material, and this is the best way to learn. It is a great break from the norm
and solidify what we know (or don't know!) by getting our hands dirty and making practical use of what we learned. Not only that, 
but we are also taught things that will help us in our future jobs (eg: learning how to collaborate, managing emotions, github/version control, etc), 
things that are rarely mentioned in textbooks, but are essential to success. I have high expectations for DBC because of the
way the material is presented and because of the great people I am going to work with.
