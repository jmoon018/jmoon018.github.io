				<h2>Enumerable#map(!) - What and Why?</h2>

				<p>
					One problem/issue that commonly arises in programming projects is dealing
					with lists. Data is commonly stored in these lists and thus it is crucial
					that programmers understand how to access and modify these data structures.
					Programmers are armed with many tools to deal with these types of problems,
					and in this blog post, I am going to discuss one in particular: Enumerable#map
				</p>	

				<p> <b>What is Enumerable#map???</b> 
					<br>
					Enumerable.map is function that loops through the all elements in an array and 
					creates a new array, with each new element being based on the expression in the block.
					In the RubyDocs, there is an example as such: <br>
					<code>(1..4).map { |i| i*i }  #=> [1, 4, 9, 16]</code>
					<br>

					<i>(1..4)</i> denotes an array, followed by the method name <i>.map</i>. Then
					a block is created, and the <i>i</i> in </i>|i|</i> means that the element
					we are iterating on can be accessed by using the <i>i</i> variable. Afterwards,
					we create an expression <i>i*i</i> which will give us the elements in the new array.
					Lastly we end the block. So if step through the code, on the first iteration,
					the new array will push <i>i*i = 1*1 = 1</i>, on the second iteration, the new
					array will push <i>i*i = 2*2 = 4</i>, and so on. 

					<br>
					.map! works just like .map, but rather than returning a new array with the
					modified values, <i>.map!</i> will directly modify the array that's being
					used and return that instead.
				</p>

				<p> 
					<b>Why use .map???</b>
					.map is a great method to create a new array based on an
					existing one. Rather than creating a new array, using <i>.each</i> to loop,
					pushing back each element, etc, we can just use .map. Imagine, for example,
					that you had a ton of names in an array, but then you decide that you want to
					format it properly by capitalizing the first letter; you can .map to go through
					each name and use *name*.capitalize as the expression. .map gives you the power
					to quickly iterate through an array and return a new array based on the old one
					but with whatever modifications you want.
