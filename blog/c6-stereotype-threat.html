				<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p>Stereotype threat describes how people unintentionally confirm/abide to negative
				stereotypes regarding their social group - people affected by stereotype threat
				have seen reductions in academic performance, increase in anxiety, and so on. I recall
				studying this in my Psychology class, and there was a great experiment done
				on steretype threat which may help you understand what it is.
				</p>

				<p>In my Psychology class, my professor showed us a video called "Eye of the Storm," 
				which was a psychology experiment in 1970 by Jane Elliot, a 4th grade teacher. After
				the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination, she wanted the students to know what it
				was like to be discriminated against. So, she divided her class based on eye color
				(blue and brown) and told them that the blue-eyed students were better and superior
				than the rest. She granted them special privileges (more recess time) and she was
				very critical of the brown-eyed students -- for example, when a brown-eyed student
				got a problem wrong, she would say something to the effect of, "Well, if you were
				a blue-eyed student, you would be smarter, but you are brown-eyed and so you are
				dumb." Okay, not quite those words, but she was trying to express the idea that 
				the students were affected by their eye color. The very, very, very perplexing part
				of this is when she compared test/flashcard results from the students, and there
				was a huge grade gap between brown- and blue-eyed students; the "superior" blue-eyed
				students performed better on virtually everything than the brown-eyed students. 
				Then, the next day, Jane Elliot reversed the roles and said that the brown-eyed
				students were actually superior and that blue-eyed students were not. The blue-eyed
				students, previously like the brown-eyed students, started showing more anxiety 
				and SURPRISINGLY also had a huge reduction in test scores. My mind is still blown;
				the simple act of categorizing people (brown vs blue eyed) and giving them
				a negative stereotype (brown-eyed are inferor! blah blah blah) can significantly 
				affect their performance and behavior. More studies were conducted as well, comparing
				the SAT scores of African-Americans and European-Americans after giving
				one group a negative stereotype; when stereotype threat was present, test scores
				between the two groups differed dramtically, but in the placebo group, the test scores
				were virtually the samae.
				</p>

				<p>It is hard for me to determine if I have ever been affected by stereotype threat.
				I try not to worry too much about what others think if it's an irrational or illogical
				statement; I quickly ignore stupid one liners like ("X race is inferior, you're stupid Jamal!").
				However, that does not mean that I was never affected. I do my best not to think about it,
				so I wouldn't recall any specific memories, and that is why I am struggling to answer
				this question. I can definitely imagine some groups being affected by stereotype threat,
				and even some groups affected by stereotype lift (the opposite of stereotype threat--being
				told you are superior and thus performing better); in the latter, I recall one of my 
				high school teachers telling my class that we were better than the others, and that
				possibly could have affected our performance (we consitently scored better than the other
				clases). To prevent/mitigate stereotype threat, it is important to educate people
				about the existence of stereotype threat. To me, it's just a mind game, and when
				I think of it as such, I think I break free from being affected by negative stereotype
				threats. If someone is affected by negative stereotypes, I would tell them about
				this phenemenom to remind them that it's just a mind trick, and I would focus on
				their positive qualities and traits instead of focusing on the bad.
