				<h2>Class Methods</h2>
				<p>There are many concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), and I will
				speak in length about one in particular: class method. Before I go into
				detail, it is important to have the basic idea of OOP. OOP is simply
				a programming paradigm in which data structures hold data and methods 
				that allow one to manipulate that data. Most data manipulation relies
				on class methods, so it is therefore important to understand when
				and how to use them.</p>

				<p>In OOP, objects contain data and methods. The data is composed
				of properties that describe the object, and methods provide ways
				to manipulate or access the object's data. They can also be used
				for "encapsulation" which is a fancy word for describing what information
				about objects are hidden and available to users. That may sound confusing,
				so let me provide an example. </p>

				<p>In real life, you have probably driven a car.
				The car gives plenty of information to you, which is important when
				you are driving: your car's speed (so you don't exceed the speed limit), 
				your car's driving mode (so you know if you are in park mode, etc), the
				radio station you are on, the sound indicating that your right/left
				blinker is on, and so on. The car also provides ways for you to
				change the car's state: you can change the radio station, use the pedals
				to change your car's speed, move the lever to turn on/off the blinker, and so on.
				</p>

				<p>However, there are also A LOT of things going on in the car that you 
				are not aware about and that you cannot change. For example, there is almost
				little to no information about how the engine of the car is performing, no
				information about the circuits and power being delivered, and so on. There
				are so many technical details about the car's engine (which I frankly can't
				describe too well) that is irrelevant to the person driving the car, and that
				is why it is HIDDEN from the driver -- or encapsulated. It is pointless for the
				driver to know. The driver only knows properties of the car that are important 
				(speed, gas level, etc) and have the tools to change that (pedals, steering wheel).
				Likewise, in programming, there may be a lot of things going on under the hood
				that we don't want the end user to touch or know about, so we only provide him
				or her with what is relevant to them.
				</p>

				<p>Class methods give users a way to interact with objects and can also
				provide information for the users if they request it. Class methods are important
				to OOP design because it allows programmers to encapsulate data as I mentioned earlier.
				You use class methods to determine the data that the user is aware of and can control
				and to fix the flow of data.
