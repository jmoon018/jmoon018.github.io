				<h2>JavaScript vs. Ruby</h2>

				<p>There are many differences and similarities between JavaScript and ruby,
				and in this blog post, I will be discussing some immediate discrepencies
				and connections that I noticed. I will then go into detail about "looping."
				<p>

				<p><b>SYNTAX</b> <br>
				The first difference I noticed was syntax. In JavaScript, <b>statements</b> are
				separated by semicolons, whereas in Ruby, newlines separate statements automatically.
				That means, in JavaScript, you could potentially have a program all on one
				line, however in practice, there are newlines and tabbings just like Ruby code
				generally is like. When working with <b>variables</b> in JavaScript, you must
				type <i>var</i> before the variable name or else it will automatically become
				a global variable.
				</p>

				<p><b>OPERATORS</b> <br>
				There are very many similarities between the basic operations, such as addition,
				subtraction, modulus, comparison, etc between the two languages. The addition operator
				can be used to find the sum of two numbers or concatenate strings. The comparison
				operator always returns true or false and can be used to compare anything (numbers,
				boolean statements, etc). Due to these similarities, I think it was very easy to begin
				coding in JavaScript after figuring out the syntax/new methods because the code
				was otherwise virtually the same. With some practice, it is very simple to translate
				a chunk of Ruby code to JavaScript code.
				</p>

				<p><b>LOOPING</b> <br>
				Looping is essential to many programs. It allows us to iterate over data structures
				(such as the list-like arrays) and access the content within. It also allows us
				to automate tasks, such as running a function a certain amount of times; we can
				run a function, say, 20 times, with a loop in just 3 lines of code, otherwise we
				would have to manually write the function 20 times, which is messy and time-consuming.
				Looping is paramount and that is why I will be discussing it into a bit more detail.
				</p>

				<p>
				In Ruby, we have access to enumerable methods which automate many tasks for us
				when working with data that can be iterated over (hashes, arrays, lists, etc). Ruby
				provides methods and syntax that greatly simplify the process of accessing data
				easily and manipulating it in virtually any way we please. This is a powerful 
				advantage of Ruby because it can quicken the development process while making
				the code clear and easy to understand.  <br>

				In JavaScript, there are many methods we can use to emulate or achieve effects
				like that of Ruby, but the syntax is not as neat. If we want to iterate nicely
				over an array, we would have to use a for loop (more lines of code). Methods
				very much like Ruby's exist in JavaScript for iterating over arrays, but there
				are some extra things we have to type -- we have to apply functions to the
				iterations, which is kinda weird. If we wanted to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">call array.reduce</a>, for example,
				the syntax would look like so: <br>

				<code>	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue, index, array) {
	  					return previousValue + currentValue;});
				</code>

				<br>
				Eeek, not so pretty, huh? Looping in Ruby is a bit more superior, but it is important
				to note that JavaScript can still provide the same functionality, it just requires
				a little bit more work.
