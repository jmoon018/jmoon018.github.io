## What are the benefits of version control?

Version control is a must-have tool for nearly any programming project. It gives
developers an orderly history of their source code, granting them the freedom to revert any (bad)
changes they make without having to start over from the beginning. Without version control, developers
would have no wiggle room for mistakes, since spotting bugs or undoing features are difficult tasks
without a clear direction (which VC provides). It's sort of like writing an essay; with version control,
you would be able press undo anytime you make an mistake, but without version control, you'd have to start your
essay over from the very beginning. The right choice is obviously the former.


====================================================

## How does git help you keep track of changes? 

Git helps keep track of changes by saving our source code each time we "commit." A 
commit is essentially the process of creating a restore point of our source code for Git, so that we may 
view or revert back to the source code if we need to. A log of each commit, along with a brief
message or description about it, is stored and the developer has free access to it.

## Why use GitHub to store your code?

GitHub is a great place to store code because it allows others to see and modify it;
that is one reason why GitHub is an essential collaboration tool. In addition, it is a good idea to
store your files in a backup in case something goes wrong with your hardrive, and GitHub can also
function as a backup.
