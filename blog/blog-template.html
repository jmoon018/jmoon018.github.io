				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
				ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
				type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
				not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
				remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
				the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
				more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
				including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
