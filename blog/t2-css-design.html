				<p>
					In this blog post, I will briefly talk about the functions and differences
					among margins, borders, and paddings (which I will refer to as MBP). You may notice there lots
					of things on websites are separated by some pixels--for example, the content of a site
					may be in the middle of your browser (there is space on the left and right side), or
					there may be an extra line between paragraphs in a blog, etc. These spacings and more
					are handled by the MBP attributes, as they define just how far apart things on a web
					page should be. Without these properties, everything would be adjacent to another element,
					and websites would look like a clustered pile of poop.
				</p>

				<p>
					Before I continue, there are a couple things you should know. Each element (text, image, etc)
					on websites have a width and height property. These give 2D, box-like "boundaries" to the elements
					and will be important when working with MBPs. MBPs can also be directly added to the
					the top, left, right, or bottom of an element.
				</p>

				<p>
					Margins are simple. When you add a margin to an element, adjacent elements
					are pushed away by the amount you specified. For example, if I have element1 to the left
					of element2, and they are next to each other, adding "margin-right:10px;" to element1 will
					push element2 away from element1 (and thus to the right) by 10px. The same effect can be
					achieved by adding "margin-left:10px;" to element2 (element2 pushes itself away). 
				</p>

				<p>
					Paddings mostly only affect the element that has the padding. Rather than pushing other elements
					away like margins, a padding is like an "inner-margin", and it'll push the content of the element
					within itself. Kinda weird. For example, if you have a rectangle, called box1, that spans
					the width of your entire screen and has text that says "Hello world!" at the very left, you can
					add paddings to move the text. If you type "padding-left:20px;" it will push EVERYTHING in box1
					to the right, because it's pushing everything from the left (and thus to the right) by 20px.
					So margins push other elements, and paddings push stuff within an element
				</p>

				<p>
					Borders can extend the boundaries of an element and make your element look fancy. You can for example
					put a border around an element, and lines (in the shape of a box) will appear and encompass the 
					element.  You can change the colors, make the border width big and fat, or really tiny. It's just a border.
					The thing to note is that when you add a border, it must have a width, and this width adds to the 
					element's current width. So for example, if an element is 50x50 pixels, and I add a border with 1px width,
					the new element size is 52 x 52px; the border goes on each on the top and bottom once, adding 2px, and
					the same applies to the left/right.
