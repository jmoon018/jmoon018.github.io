				<h2>My Thinking Style and Learning</h2>

				<p>
					The biggest strugle for me in Phase 0 thus far has been the time management. Week1 was
					pretty straightforward, so I didn't have much difficulty, but Week 2, the material was more
					difficult, and I was faced with four midterms/quizzes in school simultaneously. I didn't
					manage my time properly and I ended up delaying my Week 2 material in order to study
					for school. As a result, the material carried over from week 2 to week 3 and made it
					a hell lot harder than it should have been. School was not as time-consuming, fortunately,
					so I had the opportunity to catch up. Another good thing for me was that the challenges
					this week were easy to me since they chiefly focused on Ruby programming, and I have
					prior programming experience. I did manage my time much better in week 3, but I want
					to continue managing my time properly so I don't have to deal with unnecessary stress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Was I struggling because of the way I think I learn? Well, according to the Gregorc
					Thinking Style test, I am: Abstract Sequential (12 points), Concrete Sequential (8),
					Concrete Random (7) and Abstract Random (3). 
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Concrete means being capable of directly getting information, focusing on the present 
							(practical), and not connecting the dots among different ideas/events/concepts etc.</li>
						<li>Abstract is being able to conceive novel ideas, using intuition, imagination, etc.</li>
						<li>Sequential means doing/thinking like a computer -- logically, and step by step</li>
						<li>Random means not thinking in organized, methodical ways, but still achieving a goal</li>
					</ul>

					So by these definitions, I excel in the Sequential mindset, and I should be better at planning
					and working. When I get my hands dirty and actually begin working, I work brutally fast; I
					can quickly craft plans to tackle a big problem, be resourceful when I stumble upon a question
					that I don't understand, and for the most part stay focused. The reason why I struggled last week,
					I think, is that I had everything planned, but I didn't follow through 100%. For example,
					I hoped to finish my homework by Wednesday (and thus expected to do DevBootcamp stuff Friday),
					but I underestimated the workload and finished it Friday. Then I was burned out from that, and was
					incapable of completing the Bootcamp material. In other words, I made a big planning error which
					snowballed into chaos as I struggled to get caught up with my schedule. One mistake led to
					an array of other mistakes, and I believe that is why I didn't have such an easy time. And honestly,
					I did just have a TON of work to do.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I plan properly, everything is nice and smooth--and even if I make minor errors, I can
					adjust and adapt fairly well. Now, when I make a major error, however, everything just falls apart.
					I do think the solution is pretty simple. I need to plan better and be more discplined. To plan better,
					I should pump some extra time in my schedule to cushion myself for when I take too long. So if I believe
					I can finish all my homework by Tuesday, I'll plan everything as if I finish Wednesday, so in the worst
					case scenario that I can't finish my homework by Tuesday, I won't be so ill-prepared. In regards
					to the discipline part, I need to begin things early, and if I act irresponsibly (starting late, not
					adhering to my schedule, etc), work hard until I get everything back on track, even if it means
					less time for gaming and sleeping.
