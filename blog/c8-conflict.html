				<h2>Conflict</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					One conflict I faced was when I was at college, sleeping in an on-campus apartment.
					I had three other roommates, two of whom I knew from the prior year. The apartment
					consisted of a shared living room / kitchen and 4 private bedrooms. While I was grateful to have
					such a nice place, there one thing I could not stand about it: the sound. The walls
					were not soundproof, at all. I could hear everything that was outside my room even
					when my door was closed: I heard my roommates cooking in the kitchen, I heard them
					talk in the living room, I heard them watch TV, I heard them even walk on the floor.
					As a light sleeper with an odd sleeping schedule and with roommates who were loud
					and generally slept late, I struggled to sleep. One of my roommates also woke up pretty 
					early (before 6), making some noise. Often, there were other people in our lounge too
					(friends, etc), even late at night, so that kept me up too. I was upset that I felt
					groggy all day, and I thought my roommates were sometimes a little bit inconsiderate
				</p>

				<p>
					At first, I tried to just sleep through everything, but that failed pretty quickly (even
					the smallest things keep me awake). I then tried to change my sleeping schedule--I tried
					sleeping at more reasonable hours, and around the times my roommates slept, so I ended
					the long 3AM HW sessions and slept before midnight and woke up much earlier. Fortunately,
					I only had a couple morning classes, so I was able to have a flexible sleeping schedule
					if I ever needed it. While that helped, I thought I could do better. I did what I should
					have done: tell my roommates that I was struggling to sleep. I was reluctant at first because
					I thought I was being petty and entitled, but I tried to sound to reasonable. After I told them,
					they were more conscious about when I was sleeping and were more quiet (by using earbuds instead
					of laptop speakers, talking in their rooms rather than the living room, etc). When they occassionally
					wanted to party or have friends over really late at night, they would ask me first, and I 
					think allowed them to come (even if I didn't want them to--as my 'gift' to them). I too
					became more mindful about when my roommates were sleeping (sometimes I was awake when they
					weren't), and I tried to be more quiet when they were not awake. I tried my best not to be
					intrusive, and in the end, I don't think they were angry at me about this.
				</p>

				<p>
					While this was a small conflict, there are still a few things to learn from it. I learned
					that it is generally a LOT easier to just voice your opinion about a problem, and voice it early,
					rather than suffer and be passive[-aggressive] as a result. After telling my roommates about
					my desire for sleep, they pretty quickly obliged, allowing me to sleep and not wake up
					groggy and grumpy. I think conflicts, especially with people you are close to, can be solved
					with communication and compromise. My roommates began asking me if it was okay for them
					to bring friends over late, and normally I said yes, and if I didn't, they went to another
					friend's room (we were all in the same building, so it wasn't too big of a deal). In turn,
					I tried to be more quiet when they were asleep and tried to adjust my schedule according to
					what they were doing (so if they wanted to use the living room for some event, I'd plan to
					stay up late). All in all, I'd sum what I learned as such. Conflicts - don't complain, communicate
					and compromise. I now call my methods the <i>CCCC</i>.
